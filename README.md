# Quake

## Why?

Inspired by Fabien Sanglard's awesome code reviews and the now abandoned HandmadeQuake project, I've decided to immerse myself in the original quake code base with the goal to improve my profiency in C and familiarise myself with the Quake family of engines.

## What?

This project is focused on simplifying and documenting the WinQuake version of the source. In particular I aim to strip out assembly optimisations, support for operating systems other than Windows and any unnecessary 3rd party dependencies.

## How?

To get started you'll need a copy of the assets from the original Quake game (it's a folder called `Id1`). Clone the repository, copy the assets into the directory and open the Quake.sln file in Visual Studio 2019 or later. Then hit `F5` to build and run in x86 debug mode.
